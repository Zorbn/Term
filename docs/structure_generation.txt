Problem:
    In an infinite world structures may be generated the occupy multiple chunks, including some that are not yet loaded.

Possible solution:
    Each structure must have a bounding box (AABB).
    Chunks should have the ability (ie: a function) to generate the part of a structure that fits inside of them.
    The world will abstract this functionality.

    Then:
        When the world generator decides a structure (ie: a tree) needs to be generated it will:
            Tell the world where the structure is,
            The world will loop over all chunks in the bounds of the structure,
            If the chunk exists then tell it to generate it's section of the structure,
            If the chunk doesn't exist add the structure to a list that stores the location of chunks and their pending structures.
            When a new chunk is created check if it is responsible for any of the structures in the list of pending structures, if so they can now be generated.

            When saving the world this list of pending structures would be saved too.
